- 👋 Hi, I’m @mzborucki
- 👀 I’m interested longer term in cleaning up my family tree some with dna analysis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some of the statistics of autosomal DNA and how to interpret data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate just a little bit on how to interpret familial relationships amongst close relationships, looking for ways to determine endogamy and pedigree collapse 2-4 generations up from me..  Don't feel I know enough to contribute much.
- 📫 How to reach me :  marie.borucki@gmail.com
